CREATE two subject lines, preview text, and corresponding email headlines for an A/B test for the course below. 

The general guidelines for writing this type of content are as follows:

- Clear Value Proposition: Ensuring the subject, preview, and headline quickly communicate the core benefit or topic of the email, answering "What's in it for me?" for the recipient.
- Grabbing Attention & Relevance: Making the subject line compelling enough to open and ensuring the preview text aligns with and expands on that initial promise.
- Benefit-Focused Language: Framing the subject and preview to highlight what the user will gain (e.g., avoid risk, gain mastery, solve a problem), which is a key theme in the guide for converting interest into action.
- Audience Resonance: Using language and addressing concerns (fear of non-compliance or desire for competence) that would likely resonate with HR professionals or managers, as suggested by understanding the target audience.

- The two version MUST be distinct enough to ensure the result is meaningful. 
- Do not use hyphens or dashes in any of the copy.
- Flesch–Kincaid readability should be between 80–90
- You MUST not use clichés
- You MUST not use obvious language

The test will always be between the fear of non-compliance vs an alternative. The fear of non-compliance version should be negative and lean into risks involved. We've found the fear of making a mistake is almost stronger than a positive approach. 

The alternative is based on the research that has been done on Continuing Professional Development (CPD). You should read the document 'Workplace Education Outcome Prioritization.docx' so that you have a deep understanding of the motivations of the audience.

This B version should focus on ambition (i.e. career advancement).
