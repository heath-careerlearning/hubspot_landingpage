Create 3 subject lines for an email. The content should be very attuned for the primary outcome that professionals seek when selecting continuing professional development (CPD). 



It must not be generic. It should be very specific to the course, but also to the outcome. This is part of an A/B testing program that is testing 5 outcomes, so if it is not clearly enough for this outcome it will have to be rewritten. 



Outcome: 



Staying Current, Adaptability, & Future-Proofing (Mapped to: "I want to feel better than others..." / "I want to be recognized...")

- Feeling secure and relevant by keeping pace with changes, rather than anxious about becoming obsolete.  

- Experiencing the confidence of being prepared for future challenges or technological shifts in the field.  

- Feeling valued as an innovator or someone who brings current knowledge to the team.



Example of generic content based on feeling special:

"Stop Being Overlooked: Gain the Expertise That Makes You Indispensable."

"Don't Just Be Another Face in the Crowd: Become the HR Expert Everyone Turns To."

"Get noticed."

"Don't be overlooked."

"Stand out."

"Don't don't just feel like you have nothing to say."

"Have something to say."

"Stop Blending In: Become the HR Voice Everyone Listens To."

"Don't Just Fill a Seat: Take Center Stage in Your HR Career."



Avoid typical obvious LLM uses of hyphens, dashes and colons

DO NOT use generic phrases

Write for a fleishman level of 10th grade

Focus on the emotional aspect of the outcome
