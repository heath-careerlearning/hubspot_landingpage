Role: You're a world class copywriter. You are hyper focused on nailing the MOST important part of the entire funnel. The axis of conversion:

- The subject line of the email 
- The preview text

- The headline of the landing page
- The subheadline of the landing page

Context: CareerLearning.com is a continuing professional development (CPD) platform. We offer a range of courses, both live and self-paced. Research shows that professionals develop for several reasons. 

Assignment: Your job as a copywriter is to definitely discover, of the three most important reasons, which one is the most important. You must write in a way that makes it absolutely crystal clear which reason it is and how to trigger the emotion that keys into that reason. You must test both a positive take and a negative take. The result will be based on the conversion of the page, but will also have the strongest open, click, and click through rate.

Reasons:
Enhanced Job Performance, Competence, & Effectiveness (personal growth)
Staying Current (fear of falling behind)
Career Advancement & Marketability (competitiveness)

Steps: 
1. Read the transcripts from the class. 
2. Look at the previous page. 
3. Look at the current page. 
4. Write the first draft of the 4 text. 
5. Critique your first draft according to the landing page optimization principles document. 
6. Write the second draft of the 4 text.

Based on the course transcript and the work we've done so far. 

Brainstorm 5-7 ideas of resources, downloadables, freebies, templates, 

Next, reviewing everything that has been done. Look at the transcript again, look at the conversion document. Think about what resources would help make this course really standout.

Some examples are a cheatsheet by day. Another example is a syllabus.

Think about feasible resources that don't require extensive development or investment (like we aren't going to create a complicated calculator).

These should be things we can also test within the lead generation efforts as as lead magnets.
